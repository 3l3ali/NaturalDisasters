                        <p>Maybe. A lot of things can cause local shaking - earthquakes, trucks driving by, thunder, etc. Earthquakes will feel different depending on the size of the earthquake and your distance from the epicenter. If it is a large earthquake, and you are close to it, you will feel a sudden bump followed by intense shaking. It will be difficult to stand. Conversely, if there is a small earthquake and you are not as close to it, you may feel a small bump, followed by a few seconds of sharp shakes.</p>

                        <p>Actually, many earthquakes happen every day. Most of them are too small to feel. On average, there is an earthquake that a few people will feel every 2-3 weeks and one that will be felt by many people every year. We cannot predict exactly when the next big earthquake will happen; we can only give a probability. Within the next 30 years, the probability is 62% that we will experience an EQ with magnitude 6.7 or greater on one of our faults.</p>

                        <p>Seismic hazard maps are maps that show expected level of shaking in a particular area due to earthquakes that may occur in the region. These can be used by local governments for construction projects for new buildings or retrofitting old ones. They can also be used by citizens concerned with seismic dangers. There are many places to find these publicly available resources and a quick Google search will yield many useful results.</p>

                        <p>The Alquist-Priolo (AP) Fault Zoning Act was passed as a response to the February 9, 1971 Mw 6.6 San Fernando earthquake. The act creates special regulatory zones, or earthquake fault zones, on and around active faults throughout California. Additionally, maps for these areas are created and distributed to relevant cities and counties. This will ensure that any construction on or near a fault can take the necessary measures to ensure public safety. The maps are also made available to the public, which can be very useful information for various purposes, such as knowing where a fault lies before buying a house.</p>

                        <p>Most modern single-family wood-frame homes in the US are safe to be in during an earthquake. Building safety depends more on building design, construction type, building material quality, soil conditions at the property site and less on the number of stories. The exception to this rule are multi-story buildings with a "soft story", a ground floor with large openings to accommodate windows or garage doors. If not properly braced, these openings can reduce the shear strength of the structure making it vulnerable to strong ground motions.</p>

                        <p>If you look at earthquake statistics in most regions of the world, including California, you will find that for every magnitude 5 earthquake, there are about 10 that have a magnitude of 4, and for each magnitude 4, there are 10 with magnitude 3. Unfortunately, this means there are not enough small earthquakes to relieve enough stress to prevent the large events. In fact, it would take 32 magnitude 5's, 1000 magnitude 4's, or 32,000 magnitude 3's to equal the energy produced in one magnitude 6 event.</p>

                        <p>The question often arises as to whether astronomical events, such as planetary alignments, can significantly influence the occurrence of earthquakes. The moon, sun, and other planetary bodies in our solar system influence the earth in the form of perturbations to the gravitational field. The relative amount of influence is proportional to the object's mass and inversely proportional to the cube of its distance from the earth. * The general idea is that strains in the earth's crust caused by perturbations in the gravitational field may influence when an impending earthquake will occur (like the straw that broke the camel's back). If this were indeed the case, we would expect to see a correlation between rate at which earthquakes occur and the perturbations to the gravitational field. The dominant perturbation in the earth's gravitational field generates the semi-diurnal (12 hour) ocean and solid earth tides which are primarily caused by the moon (due to its proximity) and the sun (due to its large mass). No significant correlations have been identified between the rate of earthquake occurrence and the semi-diurnal tides when using large earthquake catalogs. There have, however, been some small but significant correlations reported between the semi-diurnal tides and the rate of occurrence of aftershocks in some volcanic regions, such as Mammoth Lakes.</p>

                        <p>There are two types of weather that we experience on earth. One type is space weather. This is weather that comes to us from beyond our own planet, such as solar flares and magnetic storms. These phenomena result in things like the Northern Lights. While this type of weather can influence our communications and other systems, it has never been shown to affect earthquakes. If there were a connection, we would see an increase in earthquakes about every 11 years, which is when solar flares are the most intense, yet we see an even distribution of earthquakes regardless of what the Sun is doing.</p>
                        <p>The other type of weather is what we are all familiar with, rain, wind, heat, etc. Again, statistically, there is an even distribution of earthquake events throughout all types of weather. However, very large low-pressure systems, such as hurricanes, have been known to cause episodes of fault slip (slow earthquakes), which are not very damaging.</p>

                        <p>Shallow crevasses can form during earthquake-induced landslides, lateral spreads, or other types of ground failures. Faults, however, do not open up during an earthquake. Movement occurs along the plane of a fault, not perpendicular to it. If faults opened up, no earthquake would occur because there would be no friction to lock them together.</p>

                        <p>There is no way for us to prevent earthquakes. After all, we can't stop the earth's tectonic plates from moving. And, although mining and reservoir activities can, and do, cause earthquakes, we can't realistically cause enough tiny earthquakes to prevent a large one. This is because for each increase in magnitude, the amount of energy released increases 32 times. So, for example, it would take about 33,000 magnitude 3 earthquakes to equal the amount of energy released in a magnitude 6.0 earthquake. (In nature, we only get about 1000 magnitude 3 quakes for every quake of magnitude 6 - not nearly enough to release all that energy.)</p>
